Current benchmarking approaches address these issues insufficiently: BUSCO assesses transcriptome completeness using conserved single-copy orthologous genes but can misinterpret alternative splicing as gene duplications, while spike-ins (SIRVs, ERCCs) oversimplify real sample complexity, neglecting RNA degradation and RNA extraction artifacts, thus inflating performance metrics. Simulation algorithms are limited in their ability to recapitulate this complexity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Transcriptome Universal Single-isoform COntrol (TUSCO), a curated reference set of genes lacking alternative isoforms that can be confidently considered as an internal ground truth. TUSCO evaluates precision by identifying transcripts deviating from reference annotations and assesses sensitivity by verifying detection completeness in human and mouse samples. Masking TUSCO transcripts -and optionally inserting decoy splice variants in the annotation- creates a Ônovel-isoformÕ challenge that assesses recovery of the true, now-unannotated isoforms. Our validation demonstrates that TUSCO provides accurate and reliable benchmarking without external controls, significantly improving quality control standards for transcriptome reconstruction using LRS.IntroductionAdvances in long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), have revolutionized transcriptomic studies by enabling the comprehensive profiling of full-length RNA molecules1. These emerging LRS platforms allow precise quantification of isoform diversity and in-depth characterization of alternative splicing at bulk2,3 and single-cell4,5 levels, tasks that short-read methods struggle to accomplish6 (reviewed in 7). Despite these breakthroughs, the Long-read RNA-Seq Genome Annotation Assessment Project (LRGASP) Consortium and other benchmarking efforts8Ð12 have shown that transcript identification, particularly the accurate detection of novel isoforms absent from current annotations, remains challenging. Factors such as sample quality, library preparation, RNA capture by the instrument, sequencing errors, as well as processing choices of analysis method may introduce biases and compromise the accuracy of transcript calls. This has motivated the development of tools and strategies for the quality evaluation of long-read transcriptomics data.Comprehensive quality control (QC) is critical for identifying potential biases and technical artifacts in LRS data. Read-level QC tools, such as LongQC13, MinKNOW (https://github.com/nanoporetech/minknow_api), SQANTI-reads14, and PycoQC (https://github.com/a-slide/pycoQC)15, assess sequencing quality using metrics including read counts, length distribution, basecalling accuracy, adapter contamination, GC content, and coverage, among others. At the transcript level, SQANTI3 is widely used for evaluating the structural novelty of transcripts, integrating complementary data such as short-read alignments, CAGE peaks, polyA motifs and polyA sites, and machine learning to improve confidence and curation of long-read defined transcriptome16. Although these tools yield valuable insights into data quality, they do not offer an absolute ground truth and therefore cannot provide formal benchmarking capabilities.Current long-read benchmarking frameworks have adopted and adapted existing short-read methods. For example, BUSCO, which measures completeness by comparing reconstructed transcriptomes against a database of conserved single-copy orthologous genes17, has been used by several LRS assessment studies18Ð20. However, BUSCO is limited in its capacity to evaluate isoform diversity, often misinterpreting alternatively spliced transcripts as gene duplications21,22. Another strategy is the utilization of spiked-in RNAs mimicking alternatively spliced transcripts, such as ERCCs23, SIRVs (lexogen.com/sirvs/), and Sequins24. These products offer LRS-tailored benchmarking capabilities but fail to capture the complexity of actual RNA samples, including RNA degradation patterns. As such, spike-ins tend to overestimate the performance of LRS methods. Finally, several data simulation algorithms, including computational strategies to simulate novel transcripts, have been proposed25Ð27. While these tools can generate comprehensive ground truth datasets for method evaluation, they face challenges in faithfully simulating the complexity of the different sources of bias present in the data, and their results need to be complemented with additional benchmarking solutions.Given these limitations, we developed the Transcriptome Universal Single-isoform COntrol (TUSCO), an internal ground truth for LRS transcript identification that can evaluate both real-sample and technology artifacts. TUSCO consists of a curated set of widely expressed genes characterized by highly conserved splice sites and the absence of evidence for alternative isoforms in the recount328 database. TUSCO offers several benchmarking advantages. First, it detects false positives by identifying TUSCO-mapped transcripts that deviate from established annotations, providing a measure of precision in transcript identification and revealing partial transcripts that may result from low sample quality. Second, it uncovers false negatives by leveraging the widespread expression of TUSCO transcripts across human or mouse samples, thereby assessing the sensitivity and completeness of transcript detection methods. Third, in its novel mode, TUSCO enables the evaluation of performance in detecting novel transcripts under conditions of incomplete annotation. Moreover, TUSCO provides direct and effortless assessment, as it eliminates the need to manage spike-in reagents or synthetic data. Our development of TUSCO satisfies a requirement in the LRS transcriptomics field by providing an internal standard for quality control.Fig. 1: Overview of TUSCO gene sets in human and mouse. aÐb, Tissue coverage of TUSCO genes across major organs in human and mouse, respectively.

Candidate genes had to have one annotated isoform with identical exonÐintron structure and strand across GENCODE and RefSeq (plus MANE Select for human)29Ð31. We then screened for unannotated alternative splicing using large Illumina-based splice junction compendia: IntroVerse (human)32 and recount3 junctions (human and mouse)28, removing loci with intragenic novel junction support above predefined thresholds (see Methods). TSS consistency was evaluated with refTSS (integrating FANTOM5, DBTSS, EPDnew, ENCODE)33; in human, we applied both exon-overlap and ±300 bp CAGE-window checks, and in mouse, we required the exon-overlap rule for single-exon genes (Methods).Expression breadth was defined using Bgee present/absent calls with stringent prevalence cutoffs (³90% of retained tissues for both species), reinforced by housekeeping genes from HRT Atlas34,35. Bgee integrates multiple expression data types (RNA-Seq, Affymetrix, in situ hybridization, ESTs) curated from healthy wild-type samples, including large resources such as GTEx36 alongside many smaller datasets, to provide a comparable reference of normal expression across species. To further favor widely expressed, splice-invariant loci, we applied AlphaGenome37-based filters on two metrics: Expression, defined as the tissue-median RPKM across reference RNA-seq panels, and Splicing, defined as the ratio of AlphaGenome-predicted counts for unannotated versus annotated splice junctions. Fixed species-specific cutoffs were used, and remaining edge cases underwent manual review by GENCODE curators.This process yielded tissue-resolved TUSCO gene sets (human: 60Ð187 per tissue; mouse: 28Ð67) and universal cores (human n = 50; mouse n = 32) consistently expressed across all tested tissues (Fig. 1 a,b). Compared with reference annotations and spike-ins, TUSCO spans endogenous size/structure ranges relevant for full-length detection: transcripts are comparable to RefSeq transcripts and longer than SIRVs/ERCCs; sets include both single- and multi-exon loci (Fig. 1c; Fig. S1). TUSCO genes also show expression distributions similar to those of medium to highly expressed genes across tissues (Fig. 1d) and, by AlphaGenome, higher expression and lower novel-junction usage than all single-isoform genes annotated in both GENCODE and RefSeq (Fig. S2). indicating that our filtering criteria were effective in selecting consistently expressed genes with minimal chances of containing hidden alternative isoforms. Together, these properties support TUSCO as an endogenous, broadly expressed, splice-invariant ground truth for benchmarking transcript identification and completeness in long-read data.TUSCO-SQANTI3: A Unified Framework for Transcript BenchmarkingTUSCO leverages the SQANTI3 framework to assign LRS transcript models to benchmarking labels (Fig. 2b). Hence, True Positives (TP) are TUSCO transcripts correctly identified by SQANTI3 as Reference Match (RM), i.e., transcript models matching a reference transcript at all junctions, with 5? and 3? ends within 50 nt of the annotated TSS and TTS, respectively. Partial True Positives (PTP) include transcripts classified as non-RM full-splice matches (FSM) or incomplete-splice matches (ISM), implying significant deviations from the reference start or end positions, which may indicate RNA degradation or incomplete sequencing. False Negatives (FN) represent TUSCO transcripts that remain undetected at the gene level, possibly reflecting insufficient sequencing depth or biases in RNA capture. False Positives (FP) are transcripts mapped to TUSCO genes as Novel in Catalog (NIC), Novel not in Catalog (NNC), Genic Intron, Genic Genomic, or Fusion events, which may arise from sequencing artifacts, incorrect transcript reconstruction, or mapping errors.These benchmarking labels allow for the calculation of standard performance metrics: sensitivity, precision, and redundancy, which are provided in a dedicated TUSCO report. Seamlessly integrated with SQANTI3, TUSCO operates without requiring additional user input, enabling users to execute TUSCO analyses directly after completing SQANTI3 processing. The incorporation of the TUSCO report within the SQANTI3 results in an enhanced, comprehensive, and unified quality control resource that both describes the properties of the long-read data and provides rigorous and standard performance metrics. Additionally, TUSCO enables a more complete assessment of the RNA sequencing workflow by capturing biases at every stageÑfrom sample preparation to RNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing, and transcript reconstructionÑunlike synthetic spike-ins such as SIRVs, which only gauge library preparation, sequencing, and transcript reconstruction (Fig. 2c).[AF1]Fig. 2: Overview of TUSCO gene selection and benchmarking framework. a, Schematic illustration of the four-step pipeline for identifying single?isoform genes suitable for benchmarking. Candidate genes are cross?referenced across multiple annotation databases (MANE, RefSeq, and Ensembl for human; RefSeq and GENCODE for mouse), evaluated for potential alternative splice sites, and checked for broad, consistent expression in multiple tissues. b, TUSCO leverages SQANTI3 structural categories to define benchmarking labels. True Positives (TP) are TUSCO transcripts correctly identified as Reference Match (RM); Partial True Positives (PTP) are those that align to alternative categories (FSM_non-RM or ISM). False Negatives (FN) indicate undetected TUSCO transcripts, whereas False Positives (FP) are transcripts with Novel in Catalog, Novel not in Catalog, Genic Intron, and Genic Genomic categories. c, High-level workflow from sample preparation to computational analysis, highlighting how different biases (sample, protocol, platform, and transcript reconstruction) can affect the user-defined transcriptome and how different benchmarking approaches assess these biases.Validation and Comparison between TUSCO and SIRVsTo assess TUSCO as an endogenous benchmark, we first compared its performance against SIRVs using comprehensive datasets from the LRGASP project. Three major library preparation workflowsÑdirect RNA (dRNA) ONT, cDNA ONT, and cDNA PacBioÑwere applied to both human WTC11 iPSCs and mouse ES cells. Transcript models were generated using the FLAIR pipeline and evaluated against either TUSCO or SIRVs (Fig. 3a).Across all library types and samples, TUSCO-derived metrics closely mirrored those obtained with SIRVs in sensitivity, precision, and redundancy (Fig. 3a). To quantify this concordance, we calculated cosine similarity (cosim) scores between the two benchmarking approaches (Table S1). Values approaching 1 indicate strong agreement in evaluating transcript reconstruction performance but do not necessarily reflect absolute performance quality. The cDNA PacBio libraries, which were the best-performing experimental option according to LRGASP results, consistently achieved cosim values near unity in both human and mouse samples, demonstrating that TUSCO and SIRV benchmarks equally recognize the performance of high-quality data. Likewise, cDNA ONT, dRNA ONT, and hybrid longÐshort read pipelines (denoted ÒLSÓ) also exhibited high agreement (cosim: 0.9553Ð0.9977), reinforcing TUSCOÕs utility as a reliable internal benchmark comparable to established spike-in controls, while also revealing small differences between the two QC datasets.Fig. 3: Comprehensive performance assessment of TUSCO and SIRVs for isoform detection across multiple sequencing platforms and pipelines, including the impact of RNA degradation on transcript recovery and analysis of false?negative genes. a, Radar plots of sensitivity (Sn), precision (Pr), and redundancy (rPre) for human WTC11 (top row) and mouse ES (bottom row) samples processed with direct RNA (dRNA) ONT, cDNA ONT, or cDNA PacBio library preparation.

Genes are labeled FN if they lack full?splice or incomplete?splice matches in long?read data or show no expression (TPM = 0) in short?read data. The arrows highlight that no FN was absent in all datasets.TUSCO More Stringently Reflects Sample Preparation and Sequencing DepthTo understand differences between TUSCO and SIRV-based metrics, we performed a detailed analysis of TUSCO genes across primary performance indicators. We compared the frequencies of true positives (TP), partial true positives (PTP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) under TUSCO or SIRVs benchmarks for human and mouse datasets (Fig. 3b). WeÊfoundÊno significant increaseÊunderÊTUSCO forÊTPÊand FP relativeÊtoÊSIRVs. InÊcontrast, PTP andÊFNÊwereÊsignificantlyÊhigher underÊTUSCO (one-sided pairedÊt-test: humanÊPTP pÊ=Ê0.0120, FN pÊ=Ê2.21 ?Ê10?3; mouseÊPTPÊpÊ=Ê0.0232, FNÊpÊ=Ê5.97 ?Ê10?4) (Fig. 3b), with both metrics higher under TUSCO. We hypothesize that because TUSCO represents endogenous transcripts, it is more sensitive to partial degradation or incomplete capture issues in sample quality and extraction that synthetic spike-ins like SIRVs or Sequins cannot fully replicate. To test this hypothesis, we applied TUSCO benchmarking to a set of ONT cDNA samples spanning a broad range of RNA integrity (RIN) values (Fig. 3c)38. TUSCO assessment revealed a higher number of PTP at lower RINs, reflecting the enhanced RNA degradation associated with low RIN samples. Notably, the fraction of fully recovered TUSCO transcriptsÑcalculated as TP / (TP + PTP)Ñstrongly correlated with the RIN value (R = 0.881, p = 1.41 ? 10?6), whereas Sequins showed no correlation (R = 0.075, p = 0.77). Accordingly, TP/(TP+PTP) values separate clearly between benchmarks: TUSCO declines at low RIN and spans a wider range, while Sequins stay consistently high across the RIN spectrum. This near-ceiling behavior arises because spike-ins are intact and insulated from extraction and degradation, so they fail to expose partial-transcript artifacts that TUSCO detects.We further examined false-negative (FN) TUSCO genes across diverse assembly pipelines and sequencing technologies within the LRGASP dataset. We asked whether we could find evidence of expression for all TUSCO genes in any of the LRGASP biological samples. We calculated the number of datasets where TUSCO genes were detected by at least one mapped read. We found that all TUSCO genes were detected in at least one dataset (Fig. 3d), confirming their expression in the biological samples and their true false-negative status when not detected. Subsequently, we investigated the impact of sequencing depth and read-length quality on the occurrence of false negatives (Fig. S2). Specifically, we correlated the number of false negatives with a composite metric defined as the logarithm of the total read count multiplied by the median read length. This analysis was conducted on pipelines utilizing exclusively long-read data as well as on those integrating both long-read and short-read sequencing. A pronounced negative correlation (Pearson r = ?0.778, p = 2.87 ? 10?3) was observed, indicating that as sequencing coverage and read length increase, the number of false negatives decreases. These findings suggest that the absence of TUSCO transcripts in specific pipelines predominantly reflects technical or coverage-based limitations[AF3], rather than a genuine lack of transcript expression, further validating the TUSCO dataset for benchmarking purposes.We concluded that by reflecting real-sample pitfallsÑincluding RNA degradation, library preparation biases, and variable read depthÑTUSCO provides a realistic, endogenously anchored benchmark strategy that surpasses synthetic controls such as SIRVs and Sequins.TUSCO-novel Evaluates the Capacity of Reconstruction Tools to Detect Unannotated IsoformsSince the TUSCO genes are well-annotated, they assess the capacity of long-read methods to detect known transcripts but do not reveal the accuracy of these methods in detecting novel transcripts, which often correspond to alternative isoforms of annotated genes39Ð41. To address this shortcoming, we developed a strategy to use the TUSCO framework to assess novel transcript calls. For each single-isoform TUSCO gene, we modified its transcript model in the reference annotation by removing one of the annotated splice junctions, inserting a plausible but artificial junction, and supplying this altered transcript model as the sole reference. This effectively updates the annotation of the single-isoform genes to reflect a nonexistent transcript while omitting the real, expressed transcript (Fig. 4a). Isoform reconstruction tools with the capacity to detect novel transcripts should call the true isoform despite a misleading annotation. We applied TUSCO-novel to Bambu, StringTie2, FLAIR, and the Iso-Seq + SQANTI3 ML pipeline across PacBio and ONT CapTrap and cDNA libraries in human and mouse (LRGASP). Performance with the native reference annotation (solid polygons, Fig. 4b) was contrasted with that under TUSCO-novel (dashed polygons).The results reveal clear distinctions in tool behavior. Bambu and StringTie2, which rely heavily on reference guidance, exhibited high performance when the true annotation was available but failed almost completely to recover the true TUSCO isoforms when only the novel simulation was provided. This sharp drop indicates that reference-driven tools struggle to detect truly novel splice junctions, even when read support is present (Fig. 4b, Fig. S4a, d). FLAIR demonstrated a more balanced profile, partially recovering the original TUSCO isoforms in the simulated novel context. However, the number of FPs and FNs remains elevated (Fig. 4b, Fig. S4e, f) under TUSCO-novel. Iso-Seq and SQANTI3 ML controlled FPs best across all pipelines, with 0 FPs reported under TUSCO-novel (Fig. S4g, h). We hypothesize that this is because the pipeline combines the ability of Iso?SeqÑa reference-free, data-driven methodÑfor transcript discovery with the SQANTI3 filter that removes transcript models lacking junction support from complementary data, thereby improving precision for novel transcripts. The relatively lower sensitivity and non-redundant precision reflect the lack of TSS or TTS adjustment to the reference in the Iso-Seq pipeline, which results in non-RM transcripts classified as partial true positives (Fig. 4, Fig. S4g, h). To verify this hypothesis, we calculated per-read coverage f=\frac{L_{\mathrm{read}}}{L_{\mathrm{exonic}}} for TUSCO transcripts, stratified by TP and PTP in human and mouse. In human, TP coverage averaged 94.47% ± 17.24% (n = 5,694), while PTP averaged 62.96% ± 47.03% (n = 320); in mouse, TP averaged 96.66% ± 9.44% (n = 4,549) and PTP 75.58% ± 29.56% (n = 2,555). Notably, PTP show much higher dispersion than TP (human IQR 0.866 vs. 0.016; mouse IQR 0.399 vs. 0.021), consistent with partial transcript coverage and confirming the impact of read length on TUSCO transcript detection for reference-free methods (Fig. S5).Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TUSCO-novel provides a realistic, controlled framework to evaluate novel isoform discovery under practical conditions where the available reference may be misleading or incomplete. By simulating biologically plausible isoforms at real genomic loci, TUSCO-novel distinguishes between tools that strongly base their transcript calls on the annotation and those capable of reference-agnostic, data-driven transcript reconstructionÑa key requirement for transcriptomics in emerging models, under-characterized tissues, or disease contexts.[AF4][AF5] Fig. 4: TUSCO-novel benchmark for evaluating multi-exon transcript discovery. a, Schematic of the TUSCO-novel approach. The native TUSCO multi-exon isoform is removed from the annotation and replaced with a simulated transcript model carrying artificial donor and acceptor splice sites. The modified annotation is used as input to reconstruction pipelines to assess their ability to recover the true (but now unannotated) isoform. b, Radar plots of six TUSCO metrics (Sn, nrPre, 1/red, 1?FDR, PDR, rPre) comparing native-reference evaluation (solid) versus TUSCO-novel (dashed) across Bambu, StringTie2, FLAIR, and Iso-Seq + SQANTI3 ML for PacBio and ONT CapTrap/cDNA libraries in human (WTC11) and mouse (ES). Bambu and StringTie2 perform well with the true reference annotation but drop sharply under TUSCO-novel, indicating strong reliance on annotation. FLAIR partially recovers true isoforms in the novel context but with elevated false positives and false negatives. Iso-Seq + SQANTI3 ML best controls false positives under TUSCO-novel (0 FPs across human and mouse), consistent with reference-free discovery followed by junction-support filtering. Lower sensitivity and precision reflect the lack of TSS/TTS adjustment in the Iso-Seq pipeline, yielding partial true positives. TUSCO helps assess replication in PacBio long-read transcriptomicsWith increasing throughout of long-read sequencing technologies, we asked if TUSCO could be useful to assist in experimental design decisions. Specifically, we used TUSCO to assess how biological replicates affect sensitivity and precision. Five cDNA libraries were prepared from mouse brain and kidney and sequenced on the PacBio Sequel IIe (approximately 5 million reads per sample; Supplementary Table 2). TUSCO metrics were computed in smart intersection (consensus) mode, i.e. considering the transcripts consistently detected across an increasing number of replicates. All possible combinations for a given replicate number were computed, and the mean and 95% confidence intervals were calculated (Fig. 5a). FLAIS was used as transcript reconstruction method.With a single ?5-million-reads replicate, most TUSCO transcripts were recovered, but precision was modest: brain sensitivity was 81.3% (95% CI, 74.5Ð88.0) with PDR 93.1% (95% CI, 89.9Ð96.4) and precision 67.1% (95% CI, 61.4Ð72.8; FDR 32.9%); kidney sensitivity was 71.9% (95% CI, 66.4Ð77.4) with PDR 90.6% (95% CI, 85.9Ð95.4) and precision 65.2% (95% CI, 61.0Ð69.4; FDR 34.8%). Requiring concordant detection in at least two replicates markedly reduced false positives with minimal change in sensitivity: precision increased to 87.8% (95% CI, 86.5Ð89.1) in brain and 81.0% (95% CI, 79.2Ð82.8) in kidney (FDR 12.2% and 19.0%, respectively), while sensitivity was 81.3% (95% CI, 79.4Ð83.1) and 70.6% (95% CI, 67.8Ð73.5). With three to five replicates, brain precision stabilized near 88.7Ð89.3%, at stable sensitivity of 83.1-84.4%). In kidney, sensitivity increased with replicate numberÑfrom 70.6% (two replicates) to 78.1% with five, while precision plateaued at approximately 79Ð81% . We attribute the larger gain in kidney sensitivity at three versus two replicates to a consensus boundary effect, whereby additional replicates refine TSS/TTS and junction boundaries, converting borderline partial matches into exact TUSCO-concordant structures.Collectively, these results indicate that TUSCO effectively reveals the effect of replication on transcript detection accuracy and suggest that, for this particular experiment (mouse brain/kidney, PacBio cDNA, FLAIR), an optimal design includes at least three biological replicates (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Table 2). By contrast, analyses of SIRV spike-in controls yielded highly consistent concordance metrics across 1Ð5 replicates, providing little guidance on replicate number optimization (Fig. S6).TUSCO universal and tissue-specific sets give similar results.Previous analyses were conducted with the universal set of TUSCO genes, which is rather small (|U| = 32). We built tissue-specific TUSCO sets to expand locus coverage and tested whether conclusions persisted (Fig. 1a,b). Tissue sets were constructed using the same single-isoform and invariance filters, requiring only consistent expression in the focal tissue; additionally, tissue-specific sets used a stricter tissue-level AlphaGenome screen (human RPKM > 3.0 and splice ratio < 0.001; mouse RPKM > 1.5 and splice ratio < 0.001), as detailed in Methods. Using the same data, the brain (65 genes) and kidney (46 genes) panels produced benchmarking metrics that were minimally lower than those of the universal set in all cases, with cosine similarity between universal and tissue results of 0.9999 for brain and 0.9992 for kidney (Fig. 5c). We concluded that the universal TUSCO set is a suitable benchmarking option for human and mouse samples, while tissue-specific sets provide slightly higher coverage to fine-tune results.Fig. 5: Replication gains and agreement between universal and tissue-specific TUSCO panels in mouse PacBio cDNA data. a, multi-sample (ÒconsensusÓ) evaluation: five biological replicates per tissue (brain, kidney) were sequenced; SQANTI3 assigns transcript models; TUSCO metrics are computed on the transcript set common to the selected replicates. b, Performance versus replication (1?5 replicates) for brain and kidney.

Values shown in the radar plots are computed per sample and then averaged across biological replicates within each tissue and panel type.Discussion The reconstruction of full-length transcriptomes using long-read sequencing technologies has revolutionized our understanding of transcript diversity. Yet, this advancement brings with it a pressing need for accurate and realistic benchmarking strategies. Our study demonstrates that synthetic spike-in controls, while useful, present significant limitations when used as stand-alone benchmarks. Tools like SIRVs and Sequins offer a controlled environment to assess transcript identification, but they fail to replicate key biological and technical variables that are intrinsic to real samplesÑsuch as RNA degradation, extraction bias, and natural variability across tissues. These shortcomings may result in artificially inflated performance estimates and obscure technology-specific limitations that are critical in challenging experimental contexts, such as clinical or disease-focused transcriptomic studies.To address these gaps, we developed TUSCO, a benchmarking framework built around a highly curated set of single-isoform endogenous genes. These genes are robustly and consistently expressed across tissues, offering a more biologically relevant and nuanced ground truth to evaluate transcriptome reconstruction performance. TUSCO surpasses synthetic benchmarks by reflecting the same degradation, extraction biases, and length distribution characteristics of native RNAs, particularly in the medium-to-long transcript length range, which is underrepresented in many synthetic datasets. This results in a more representative assessment of sequencing performance.Moreover, because TUSCO genes are endogenous and tissue-resolved, they enable benchmarking across a wide variety of experimental settings and sample qualities. This versatility makes TUSCO particularly valuable for several practical applications. For example, we show that the framework can inform trade-offs between sequencing depth and number of replicates, a common dilemma in experimental design. TUSCO also enables structured evaluation of novel transcript detection. While the current implementation focuses on novel splice junctions, the method can be easily adapted to assess alternative transcription start sites (TSS), transcription termination sites (TTS), or transcript disambiguation by modifying the underlying GTF annotations. We demonstrated the utility of TUSCO in both human and mouse samples, with gene sets adaptable to tissue-specific or cross-tissue applications. This flexibility ensures that researchers working on tissues not directly included in the resource can still leverage the TUSCO framework. If adopted widely by the community, the approach could be extended to additional species where sufficient transcriptomic data exist to define a reliable set of single-isoform genes.Despite its advantages, TUSCO also has limitations. It is inherently restricted to single-isoform loci and thus cannot evaluate transcript reconstruction accuracy within highly complex multi-isoform genesÑa domain where synthetic spike-ins, with alternatively spliced genes, remain useful. However, our comparison with SIRVs shows that true positive (TP) rates were similar across both approaches, suggesting similar capacity for assessing the identification of the right junction chain. However, synthetic controls failed to capture sample-specific variation in pre-sequencing biases, as reflected by greater discrepancies in precision and false negative (FN) rates, which are better illuminated by the TUSCO gene-set. As sequencing error rates continue to drop, biases introduced during RNA extraction and library preparation are likely to become the dominant limiting factors. In this context, the endogenous nature of TUSCO genes offers a crucial advantage.Another important consideration is the potential future discovery of alternative isoforms in currently annotated single-isoform genes. While the current TUSCO set is based on extensive sequencing evidence, continual updates and cross-referencing with evolving GENCODE annotations will be necessary to maintain its accuracy[AF6][AF7]. Additionally, the framework has not yet been applied to conditions involving transcriptome divergence: miss-processed sample-specific transcripts that may accumulate, for example, in situations of cellular stress42. Although TUSCO has not been specifically applied to stress-related conditions, we propose it may be a useful tool for detecting transcriptome alterations under such scenarios, as rising false positive rates could reflect increased RNA processing errors associated with cellular stress.In summary, TUSCO provides a powerful, biologically grounded framework to evaluate the performance of long-read transcriptomics across real-world conditions. By bridging the gap between synthetic controls and complex biological samples, it offers a more realistic benchmark to guide method development, protocol optimization, and experimental design.MethodsTUSCO gene selection pipelineTUSCO was constructed with a single, reproducible pipeline that integrates multi-source annotations, population splicing and TSS evidence, and broad expression compendia, and then enforces strict Òno evidence for alternative isoformsÓ criteria. For human, we retrieved and harmonized GENCODE43 v49, RefSeq44 GRCh38.p14 (GCF_000001405.40), and MANE45 v1.4 annotations together with an Ensembl BioMart Ensembl?RefSeq/NCBI mapping46; or mouse, we used GENCODE vM38 and RefSeq GRCm39 with the corresponding Ensembl BioMart mapping. After normalizing chromosome labels where needed, we identified genes that are single-isoform in each source and required exact identity of exonÐintron structure and strand across all GTFs; only those cross-annotation matches were retained and propagated with synchronized mapping subsets.We next screened for population-level alternative splicing and TSS inconsistencies. Splice evidence was derived from recount3 junction BEDs28. For each multi-exon gene, we computed the mean coverage of annotated junctions, \mu, and declared a novel junction as supporting an alternative isoform if it was fully intragenic, strand-consistent, and its coverage exceeded T = 0.10 * \mu, with a minimum absolute cutoff of one supporting read; novel junctions shorter than 80 bp were ignored. TSS evidence was assessed with refTSS v4.133. In human, we required single-exon loci to pass both an exon-overlap check (exactly one refTSS interval must overlap the TSS exon and contain the transcriptÕs TSS coordinate) and a CAGE window check centered at the transcript TSS that removed loci with more than one peak in a ±300 bp window; multi-exon loci were also evaluated with the ±300 bp window. In mouse, TSS screening was restricted to single-exon genes using the exon-overlap rule. For human only, we further removed genes flagged by IntroVerse_80 as having widespread novel isoform usage in population data (>80% of samples)32.Expression-based universality and tissue sets were then established using the resources and thresholds specified in the analysis configuration. For human, we used Bgee present/absent calls and RNA-Seq library metadata, retained calls of Ògold qualityÓ, Òsilver qualityÓ, or Òbronze qualityÓ, and restricted analysis to tissues with at least 25,000 distinct expressed genes; genes were called universal if present in at least 90% of retained tissues34. For mouse, we used Bgee with the same minimum tissue gene coverage (25,000) and accepted Ògold qualityÓ and Òsilver qualityÓ calls, calling universal genes at a 90% prevalence threshold across retained tissues. Anatomical entity IDs were mapped to tissue names, and per-tissue gene sets were emitted using those IDs. To reinforce universality, we merged housekeeping genes from HRT Atlas into the universal set when available35. Where specified (e.g., mouse kidney), we intersected tissue-specific sets with ENCODE-derived calls using median RPKM ³ 1.0 and prevalence ³ 95% at RPKM > 0.1 [ENCODE].To ensure consistency at the population level beyond presence/absence, we applied an AlphaGenome-based RPKM screen to the post-expression gene set with species- and class-specific thresholds37. In human, genes were retained only if the median RPKM across mapped tissues was ³ 4.0 for single-exon genes or ³ 0.25 for multi-exon genes; if at least 95% (single-exon) or 90% (multi-exon) of tissues showed RPKM exceeding 0.5 (single-exon) or 0.05 (multi-exon); and if at least 90% of tissues had an unannotated-to-annotated splice ratio < 0.01 (splice purity ³ 0.90). In mouse, the corresponding criteria were: median RPKM ³ 0.5 (single-exon) or ³ 0.25 (multi-exon); prevalence ³ 90% at RPKM > 0.01 (single-exon) or > 0.005 (multi-exon); and splice purity ³ 0.90 with splice ratio < 0.01. When reporting tissue-specific sets, an additional tissue-level AlphaGenome screen was applied using tissue RPKM and splice-ratio thresholds; for human we required RPKM > 3.0 and splice ratio < 0.001 in the tissue of interest, and for mouse RPKM > 1.5 and splice ratio < 0.001. A small, curated exclusion list was applied at the end to remove remaining edge cases. The pipeline writes synchronized mapping subsets alongside each GTF subset and records, for every removed gene, the first filter responsible for the removal.Sample Preparation, Library Construction, and Computational Pipeline Parameters Long-read RNA-seq datasets used in this study were derived from multiple sources to enable a robust evaluation of transcriptome reconstruction using the TUSCO framework. Data were collected from both public repositories and our laboratory to provide diverse experimental conditions. The LRGASP dataset comprises long-read sequencing data generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platforms. These data, which include samples from human WTC11 induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, were retrieved from the Synapse repository (https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn25007472/wiki/608702). The RNA degradation experiment data were obtained to assess the impact of sample quality on transcript recovery. FAST5 and FASTQ files for these experiments are available via the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession PRJEB53210, and additional FASTQ files from a post-mortem brain sample are accessible from the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) under accession EGAS00001006542. Mouse kidney dataset (PacBio Iso-Seq, 3-month-old cohort). Kidneys were dissected from five male C57BL/6J wild-type mice (3 months old). Brain samples used in this study were obtained from the same cohort of 3-month-old male C57BL/6J mice. Tissues were homogenized using FastPrep, and total RNA was extracted with the Maxwell 16 LEV simplyRNA Purification Kit. cDNA synthesis and sample barcoding followed PacBio Iso-Seq recommendations using the NEBNext Single Cell/Low Input cDNA Synthesis & Amplification kit. Five barcoded Iso-Seq libraries (K31ÐK35) were prepared with the Iso-Seq SMRTbell prep kit 3.0 and sequenced on a PacBio Sequel IIe. This dataset will be made publicly available upon publication.Mouse-specific laboratory procedures. RNA quantity and integrity were assessed prior to library preparation (e.g., Agilent Bioanalyzer to obtain RIN values). Library preparation strictly followed the PacBio Iso-Seq workflow: full-length cDNA amplification and barcoding, SMRTbell construction with the Iso-Seq SMRTbell prep kit 3.0, and sequencing on the Sequel IIe platform. Run and enzyme/incubation parameters followed the manufacturerÕs recommendations for Iso-Seq libraries. Lexogen SIRV-Set 1 spike-ins were added at 3% (E0 mix to brain samples and E1 mix to kidney samples). For all datasets, alignment of reads to the reference genome was conducted using minimap2 (version 2.0). The reference genome FASTA assemblies were GRCh38/hg38 primary assembly for human and GRCm39/mm39 for mouse, and alignments were performed with parameters specifically tuned for long-read RNA-seq data. Presets were stratified by platform: PacBio Iso-Seq (HiFi) used -ax splice:hq, while ONT cDNA or direct RNA used -ax splice (with -k14). Key settings included the use of the -ax splice option for spliced alignment (as applicable), --secondary=no to suppress secondary alignments, and -C5 to penalize ambiguous mappings. The flag -uf was enabled to guide canonical splice-site discovery and strand/orientation inference during spliced alignment, and the maximum intron length was set to 2,000,000 nucleotides via the -G 2000000 parameter. Platform-specific options recommended by minimap2 for PacBio and ONT long-read RNA-seq were applied where relevant. Code is provided as Supplementary File S2.For transcript quality control and classification, the SQANTI3 pipeline (version 5.0) was applied. In general, the pipeline uses reference annotation, genome, and CAGE peak data specific to the organism under study. The workflow is divided into three major stages: a quality control (QC) stage using sqanti3_qc.py, a filtering stage using sqanti3_filter.py that applies criteria defined in a default JSON configuration file to remove low-confidence transcript models, and a rescue stage using sqanti3_rescue.py to recover valid transcripts that may have been overly filtered16. We ran the pipeline with common options such as --skipORF to bypass open reading frame prediction and provided coverage filesÑSTAR-derived splice-junction files (SJ.out.tab) generated from Illumina short-read alignments to support splice-junction validation. Illumina reads were mapped with STAR in two-pass mode against GRCh38/hg38 or GRCm39/mm39 using standard RNA-seq settings, and the resulting junctions were supplied to SQANTI3.Transcriptome Reconstruction with FLAIRWe reconstructed transcriptomes for three datasets Ñ(i) the LRGASP project (Oxford Nanopore [MinION R10.4.1] and PacBio SequelÊII), (ii) the RNA degradation dataset (Oxford Nanopore direct RNA [GridION R9.4.1]), and (iii) the replicated Mouse Brain & Kidney dataset (PacBio SequelÊIIe and Oxford Nanopore cDNA [R9.4.1])Ñusing FLAIR v2.047. Briefly, raw long?read sequencing data were first converted to FASTQ format. Reads were then aligned to the reference genome (GRCh38/hg38 for human; GRCm39/mm39 for mouse) using FLAIRÕs align functionality, which internally wraps minimap2 to produce BED?formatted alignments. Alignment files were refined with the correct module to adjust splice junctions and transcript boundaries based on an external reference GTF annotation, with Illumina short-read support applied only in the LRGASP long+short (LS) dataset.TUSCO metrics calculationWe curated a single-isoform GTF reference (ÒTUSCO reference setÓ) comprising genes with no evidence of alternative splicing. Using the SQANTI3 classification file, we restricted evaluation to reconstructed transcripts that map to TUSCO genes, matched by the predominant identifier present in the classification (Ensembl, RefSeq, or gene symbol). We labeled as true positives (TP) those reference_match transcripts that reproduce the TUSCO exon-intron structure, including qualifying mono-exon calls when the reference has one exon and both TSS and TTS are within +/-50 bp; partial true positives (PTP) were full-splice_match or incomplete-splice_match transcripts that deviate at the 5' or 3' ends; false positives (FP) were transcripts within TUSCO genes labeled novel_in_catalog, novel_not_in_catalog, genic, or fusion; and false negatives (FN) were TUSCO genes with no observed transcript in any structural category. Let G be the number of TUSCO genes, N the number of observed transcripts mapping to TUSCO genes, TP the number of TP transcripts, PTP the number of PTP transcripts, FP the number of FP transcripts, TP_g the number of TUSCO genes with at least one TP transcript, D the number of TUSCO genes detected by either TP or PTP, and T_fsm+ism the total number of full-splice_match plus incomplete-splice_match transcripts. From these quantities we calculated: Sn = 100 * TP_g / G; nrPre = 100 * TP / N; rPre = 100 * (TP + PTP) / N; PDR = 100 * D / G; FDR = 100 * (N - TP) / N; FDeR = 100 * FP / N; redundancy = T_fsm+ism / D.Intersection mode across replicates. For replicate analyses, we computed TUSCO metrics on a k-way intersection call set that retains only transcript structures reconstructed in all of the k selected replicates. Within each replicate, SQANTI3-classified transcripts were first assigned to TUSCO genes and collapsed by structure (identical junction chain; TSS/TTS considered equivalent within ±50 bp). A structure entered the intersection if an equivalent collapsed transcript appeared in every replicate; one representative was then chosen by (i) minimum summed 5?/3? end deviation from the TUSCO model, (ii) higher read support, (iii) longer length. Correctness labels (TP, PTP, FP) and all downstream metrics (Sn, nrPre, rPre, PDR, FDR, FDeR, redundancy) were computed exclusively on this intersection set; FN were TUSCO genes lacking TP or PTP in the intersection. This conservative strategy emphasizes reproducibility, sharply reducing spurious calls while preserving consistently detected transcripts.Data availability and code availabilityPublicly available long-read RNA-seq datasets used in this study include the LRGASP data for human WTC11 iPSC and mouse ES cells, accessible at the Synapse repository under Synapse: syn25007472/wiki/608702. The RNA degradation datasets are deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession PRJEB53210, with supplementary FASTQ data for post-mortem brain samples available from the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) under accession EGAS00001006542. The Replicated Mouse Brain and Kidney dataset, generated in-house, has been submitted in its entirety to the ENA under accession PRJEB94912 (secondary accession ERP177675, ÒSequencing of mice kidneys using Iso-SeqÓ). The dataset will be released publicly upon publication.For benchmarking, the universal and tissue-specific TUSCO gene sets for human, and mouse can be freely obtained at https://github.com/ConesaLab/SQANTI3 and at the dedicated TUSCO portal https://TUSCO.uv.es.All scripts used to generate the Figures in this study and to implement the TUSCO gene selector are available at https://github.com/TianYuan-Liu/tusco-paper.Supplementary Figures[AF8]Fig. S1.

ViolinÐbox plots compare AlphaGenome-derived scores for TUSCO genes with single-isoform genes annotated in both GENCODE and RefSeq for human and mouse. The top row shows the Expression score (gene-level tissue-median RPKM); the bottom row shows the Splicing score (the bottom row shows the Splicing score (for each gene, the maximum AlphaGenome-predicted unannotated-to-annotated splice-junction count ratio across tissues). Values are plotted as log?? (score + 1e?4). Across both species, TUSCO genes exhibit substantially higher expression and lower novel splicing score ratios than other single-isoform genes, consistent with their selection as widely expressed, splicing-invariant controls. Box centers mark medians; boxes span the interquartile range; whiskers extend 1.5? IQR. Colors: Human TUSCO (light green), Mouse TUSCO (darker green), Human Other (light gray), Mouse Other (dark gray).Fig. S3: False negatives decrease with effective sequencing yield. Scatter plot showing the percentage of recomputed TUSCO false negatives (y-axis) versus a composite metric, Log (Total Reads) ? Median Read Length (x-axis), across LRGASP datasets. Point shape encodes method (triangle: ONT-cDNA; diamond: ONT-dRNA; circle: PacBio-cDNA), color indicates cell line (ES, WTC11), and point size denotes short-read support (larger = yes). Labels include dataset names; Ò-LSÓ marks libraries with length selection. A linear fit with 95% confidence band (gray) reveals a strong negative correlation (Pearson r and p shown on plot), indicating that higher effective depth and longer reads substantially reduce false negatives, consistent with technical rather than biological causes. Total TUSCO genes: human n=57; mouse n=30.Fig. S4: Performance of long-read transcriptome reconstruction pipelines on the TUSCO benchmark for discovering unannotated genes. Panels aÐh (a, Bambu-Novel; b, Bambu-Reference; c, StringTie-Novel; d, StringTie-Reference; e, FLAIR-Novel; f, FLAIR-Reference; g, Iso-Seq-Novel; h, Iso-Seq-Reference) show stacked-bar summaries for each human (WTC11-*) and mouse (ES-*) sample: total bar height equals the number of multi-exon TUSCO genes assessed, colors indicate SQANTI3 structural categories (legend). Turquoise RM segments correspond to full splice matches with identical transcription start and termination and are scored as true positives (TP); alternative 3?, 5? or 3?/5? ends plus ISM represent partial true positives (PTP); NIC, NNC and other genic/intergenic classes constitute false positives (FP); grey ÒMissingÓ portions are false negatives (FN). Numeric overlays list TP, PTP, FP and FN for each bar. In the Novel regime the authentic TUSCO isoform was replaced by a synthetic splice-junction variant (TUSCO-novel), forcing pipelines to rediscover the true isoform in the presence of a misleading annotation, whereas the Reference regime uses the unedited annotation to measure classical recall. Fig. S5: Per-read coverage of TUSCO transcripts in LRGASP Iso-Seq cDNA data. Violin-plus-boxplots show the distribution of per-read coverage f = Lread/Lexonic for TUSCO-mapped reads, faceted by species (Human WTC11, Mouse ES). Reads are labeled by SQANTI as TP (full-splice match; reference_match) or PTP (incomplete/partial splice match). Only multi-exon TUSCO transcripts are included; reference- and novel-evaluation classifications are combined; no TSS-based filtering; outliers retained; y-axis 0Ð2.0. Human: TP 94.5% (median 99.8%, n=5,694); PTP 63.0% (median 19.5%, n=320). Mouse: TP 96.7% (median 98.7%, n=4,549); PTP 75.6% (median 83.8%, n=2,555).Figure S6: SIRV spikein controls show minimal dependence on replicate number. Concordance metrics (sensitivity, nonredundant precision, inverse redundancy, 1?FDR, PDR, F1) were computed on FLAIRidentified SIRV transcripts from PacBio Sequel IIe cDNA libraries (~5 M reads per library). Metrics were summarized across all replicate combinations for 1Ð5 biological replicates (bars: mean with 95% CI; points: individual combinations). Performance was essentially invariant with replicate number: precision, inverse redundancy and 1?FDR were ~100% at all levels; brain sensitivity was 86.1% (83.7Ð88.5) at 1 replicate and ~85.5% at 3Ð5; kidney sensitivity ranged 80.3% (78.4Ð82.1; 2 replicates) to 87.0% (5 replicates). F1 remained stable (brain ~92.2%; kidney ~89.0Ð93.0%). These results indicate that SIRV spikeins yield highly consistent concordance irrespective of replicate count.Supplementary tablePipelineCosimMouse ESES dRNA ONT0.9903Mouse ESES cDNA ONT0.9977Mouse ESES cDNA PacBio0.9997Mouse ESES dRNA ONT LS0.9903Mouse ESES cDNA ONT LS0.9952Mouse ESES cDNA PacBio LS0.9997Human WTC11WTC11 dRNA ONT0.9961Human WTC11WTC11 cDNA ONT0.9553Human WTC11WTC11 cDNA PacBio0.9977Human WTC11WTC11 dRNA ONT LS0.9973Human WTC11WTC11 cDNA ONT LS0.9553Human WTC11WTC11 cDNA PacBio LS0.9974Table S1. Cosine similarity (cosim) between SIRV- and TUSCO-derived performance profiles across sequencing pipelines for mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and human WTC11 cells. For each pipeline, six evaluation metricsÑnon?redundant sensitivity (Sn), non?redundant precision (nrPre), inverse redundancy (1/red), one minus false?discovery rate (1?FDR), positive detection rate (PDR), and redundant precision (rPre)Ñwere computed as percentages for SIRVs and for TUSCO. Cosim is the cosine of the angle between the resulting six?dimensional vectors and quantifies concordance between the two benchmarks: values near 1 indicate highly similar profiles, values near 0 indicate little concordance, and negative values indicate opposing trends.

I might be overworrying but perhaps we could add another column heading - something like "Status" for the TP, PTP, etc?[AF2]brief explanation of TS classes would be good[AF3]does this include decisions by the transcript annotation tools to not include models with lower support - or do you think thats a separate class of error? - sorry if this is dealt with later! [AF4]fussy again but the panel a added model looks like it has all new splice sites but the description in the text says only 1[AF5R4]I can see that the description in the figure legend reflects the figure - so (if I'm reading this right) the inconsistency is with the text[AF6]I can see that this does present a risk as the direction for GENCODE is almost certainly in the addition of transcripts (although some may be removed) - I think that even where novel transcripts are found at TUSCO genes there could be a more generalised (and potentially less clean/harder to make clean)method that utilises knowledge of dominantly expressed transcripts at genes with alt splicing - and I think that this knowledge will grow - both in general and by tissue[AF7R6]I wouldn't see it working in exactly the same way but principals carried through [AF8]are any of the transcript reconstruction methods tested known to reject single exon genes?
